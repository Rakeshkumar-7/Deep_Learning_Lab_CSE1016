| S. no | Experiment                      | Outline                                                      |
| :---: | :------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   1   | Creating our own Neural Network | Read a few chapters of the "Grokking Deep Learning" book and created my own Neural Network |
|   2   | FC layers Hyperparameter Tuning | Tuning hyperparameters using Tensorflow's RandomSearch method |
|   3   | CNN Basics                      | Training and evaluating CNN models on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in the lab. As an assignment, trained the model using the Covid-19 X-ray dataset |
|   4   | CNN Hyperparameter Tuning       | Tuning the hyperparameters manually as well as by using GridSearchCV method from sklearn module |
|   5   | Transfer Learning               | Learnt transfer learning practically and applied it practically on animal classification dataset. VGG19 model trained on the ImageNet dataset was used for transfer learning |
|   6   | RCNN                            | Learnt about Recurrent-CNN, IoU (Intersection over Union) and bounding boxes for object detection |
|   7   | YOLO - Object detection         | Used transfer learning on the YOLO object detection model and tested it on my own desk/setup. Worked decent |
|   8   | RNN                             | Learnt to create an RNN that could write like shakespeare as shown in the tensorflow's example. Then created an RNN that could write stories (dataset obtained from textfiles.com) |
|   9   | Transformers                    | Learnt about transformers and created a sentiment analysis model using BERT |
|  10   | Speech recognition using LSTM   | Learnt about LSTM and trained a model for speech recognition |
|  11   | GAN                             | Trained a GAN to generate the MNIST dataset                  |
